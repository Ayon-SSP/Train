# Develop a HTTP Microservice to display all trains in the next 12 hours with their seat availability & pricing.


Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js Express
I have begun developing my backend using the Node.js Express framework. I created a REST API that manages train data. In this setup, I fetch the train data and perform the necessary data processing on the backend based on specific conditions. Once the data is processed, I send it to the frontend. On the frontend side, my focus is solely on rendering the data. By handling the preprocessing step on the backend, I can ensure that the client-side performance is not impacted by the processing of large data sets. This approach has made the process much simpler and more efficient for me on the frontend.
