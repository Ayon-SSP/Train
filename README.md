# Train Schedule Application
> Develop a HTTP Microservice to display all trains in the next 12 hours with their seat availability & pricing.


## Frontend: React.js
The train schedule data is processed within the frontend application, leveraging the power of modern web browsers to handle complex calculations and manipulations. By processing the data on the client-side, the application avoids excessive server load and reduces latency, resulting in a faster and more responsive user experience.

## Backend: Node.js Express
> I have begun developing my backend using the Node.js Express framework. I created a REST API that manages train data. In this setup, I fetch the train data and perform the necessary data processing on the backend based on specific conditions. Once the data is processed, I send it to the frontend.

## Token Regeneration
The application secures communication between frontend and backend using access tokens. Tokens have limited lifespan for security. Backend checks token validity and initiates authentication if needed. It exchanges credentials with authentication API for a fresh token. Frontend focuses on user experience while backend handles authentication and token management, improving security and control.


## Seamless User Interface

The frontend application, built using React, utilizes the processed data to render a visually appealing and user-friendly train schedule. The schedule includes train names, numbers, departure times, available seats, prices, and any relevant delays. Users can interact with the schedule, filter and sort the data, and seamlessly navigate through the available options.

## Benefits
- *Reduced Server Load:* By performing data processing in the frontend, the server is relieved from resource-intensive calculations, resulting in improved scalability and performance.
- *Responsive User Experience:* Processing data on the client-side enables real-time updates and a faster response to user interactions, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
- *Flexible Data Manipulation:* With the power of modern web browsers, the frontend application can efficiently handle complex calculations, filtering, and sorting operations on the train schedule data.
- *Customization and Interactivity:* Users can personalize their viewing experience by applying filters and sorting options, allowing them to focus on the specific train schedules that meet their needs.




## Getting Started
To set up the Train Schedule Application on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize the data processing logic in the frontend application to meet your specific requirements. Update the processing algorithms, filters, and any other necessary functionality.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend application using `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your web browser.
